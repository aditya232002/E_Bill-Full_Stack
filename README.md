## My First Java Project ðŸš€

This is my first project after learning Java programming. I am using this project to learn **Java Full Stack**.

### ðŸ“Œ Tech Stack:
**Front-End**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular  
- **Back-End (Current Stage)**: Java (Console-based using switch case)  
- **Next Step**: Spring Boot for Full-Stack Development  

This project is helping me build a strong foundation in Java and Full Stack Development.
